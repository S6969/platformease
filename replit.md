# PlatformEase - Domain Owner & Traffic Expert Partnership Platform

## Overview

PlatformEase is a static web application designed to connect domain owners who have hosting resources with traffic experts (bloggers and content creators). The platform facilitates revenue-sharing partnerships where domain owners provide the hosting foundation while traffic experts create content and drive visitors to monetize the domains.

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS media queries
- **Interactive Features**: Canvas-based charts, animated counters, dashboard mockups
- **Advanced UI**: Timeline components, trust badges, dashboard previews

### Server Architecture
